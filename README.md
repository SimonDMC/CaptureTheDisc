# EventCTW
Hypixel's Capture the Wool-esque minigame for an event

heavily WIP, schematic used rn is placeholder until we get a custom map

schematic copying doesn't work atm, so you'd have to copy over the .schem manually, but apart from that everything should work fine

start with /startctw, capture the other team's disc to end or type /forcestopctw to terminate
