# CaptureTheDisc
A minigame inspired by Hypixel's Capture the Flag.

## Usage
To set the game up, use `/pastemap`, which should teleport all players
to the correct world. Start a game with `/startctd`, end a game by 
capturing a disc. If you need to terminate the game for whatever 
reason, use `/forcestopctd`.

## Performance Metrics
To get updates on performance, use `/togglectdperformance`.
The performance log shows how long each runnable takes to execute.

## Map
The current map in usage is not entirely finished, but the core of it 
will  remain the same. All the locations are configured for this map, 
so the game is currently fully playable.
